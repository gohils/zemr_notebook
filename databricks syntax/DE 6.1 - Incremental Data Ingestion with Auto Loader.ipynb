Reliably processing only the new data reduces redundant processing and helps enterprises reliably scale data pipelines.\n\nThe first step for any successful data lakehouse implementation is ingesting into a Delta Lake table from cloud storage. \n\nHistorically, ingesting files from a data lake into a database has been a complicated process.\n\nDatabricks Auto Loader provides an easy-to-use mechanism for incrementally and efficiently processing new data files as they arrive in cloud file storage. In this notebook, you'll see Auto Loader in action.\n\nDue to the benefits and scalability that Auto Loader delivers, Databricks recommends its use as general **best practice** when ingesting data from cloud object storage.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n* Execute Auto Loader code to incrementally ingest data from cloud storage to Delta Lake\n* Describe what happens when a new file arrives in a directory configured for Auto Loader\n* Query a table fed by a streaming Auto Loader query\n\n## Dataset Used\nThis demo uses simplified artificially generated medical data representing heart rate recordings delivered in the JSON format. \n\n| Field | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| device_id | int |\n| mrn | long |\n| time | double |\n| heartrate | double |"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"93fd6019-ff6d-4392-8d42-2cef543e21fc"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Getting Started\n\nRun the following cell to reset the demo and configure required variables and help functions."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"aaa4ec88-a578-4cae-9617-b1ecd3237416"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-06.1"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"2319b848-e8ba-41ab-8e55-eb8b4523332f"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Using Auto Loader\n\nIn the cell below, a function is defined to demonstrate using Databricks Auto Loader with the PySpark API. This code includes both a Structured Streaming read and write.\n\nThe following notebook will provide a more robust overview of Structured Streaming. If you wish to learn more about Auto Loader options, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.\n\nNote that when using Auto Loader with automatic <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader-schema.html\" target=\"_blank\">schema inference and evolution</a>, the 4 arguments shown here should allow ingestion of most datasets. These arguments are explained below.\n\n| argument | what it is | how it's used |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **`data_source`** | The directory of the source data | Auto Loader will detect new files as they arrive in this location and queue them for ingestion; passed to the **`.load()`** method |\n| **`source_format`** | The format of the source data |  While the format for all Auto Loader queries will be **`cloudFiles`**, the format of the source data should always be specified for the **`cloudFiles.format`** option |\n| **`table_name`** | The name of the target table | Spark Structured Streaming supports writing directly to Delta Lake tables by passing a table name as a string to the **`.table()`** method. Note that you can either append to an existing table or create a new table |\n| **`checkpoint_directory`** | The location for storing metadata about the stream | This argument is passed to the **`checkpointLocation`** and **`cloudFiles.schemaLocation`** options. Checkpoints keep track of streaming progress, while the schema location tracks updates to the fields in the source dataset |\n\n**NOTE**: The code below has been streamlined to demonstrate Auto Loader functionality. We'll see in later lessons that additional transformations can be applied to source data before saving them to Delta Lake."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"aa415129-e498-47f7-91ce-bb5662727d3c"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def autoload_to_table(data_source, source_format, table_name, checkpoint_directory):\n    query = (spark.readStream\n                  .format(\"cloudFiles\")\n                  .option(\"cloudFiles.format\", source_format)\n                  .option(\"cloudFiles.schemaLocation\", checkpoint_directory)\n                  .load(data_source)\n                  .writeStream\n                  .option(\"checkpointLocation\", checkpoint_directory)\n                  .option(\"mergeSchema\", \"true\")\n                  .table(table_name))\n    return query"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"c60c4a64-6c76-40bd-9cdf-e70e87c59bb9"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the following cell, we use the previously defined function and some path variables defined in the setup script to begin an Auto Loader stream.\n\nHere, we're reading from a source directory of JSON files."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f593e5dc-11d1-48ec-89ec-08cc01728c6e"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["query = autoload_to_table(data_source = f\"{DA.paths.working_dir}/tracker\",\n                          source_format = \"json\",\n                          table_name = \"target_table\",\n                          checkpoint_directory = f\"{DA.paths.checkpoints}/target_table\")\n"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"4dc905b2-2465-4108-9721-18fe5ced2793"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Because Auto Loader uses Spark Structured Streaming to load data incrementally, the code above doesn't appear to finish executing.\n\nWe can think of this as a **continuously active query**.
