We can join fields from various bronze tables to enrich streaming records, or update account statuses based on recent activity.\n\n- **Gold** tables provide business level aggregates often used for reporting and dashboarding. This would include aggregations such as daily active website users, weekly sales per store, or gross revenue per quarter by department. \n\nThe end outputs are actionable insights, dashboards and reports of business metrics.\n\nBy considering our business logic at all steps of the ETL pipeline, we can ensure that storage and compute costs are optimized by reducing unnecessary duplication of data and limiting ad hoc querying against full historic data.\n\nEach stage can be configured as a batch or streaming job, and ACID transactions ensure that we succeed or fail completely."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"413142b6-dcca-464c-89b6-3ab9dd3e0e3e"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Datasets Used\n\nThis demo uses simplified artificially generated medical data.
